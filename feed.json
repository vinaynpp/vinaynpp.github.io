I didn't use to get good marks in history but scored well in science and mathematics. So I approached my school teacher for the solution. Her solution changed my approach towards studies. </div>\n<div> </div>\n<div>She asked me to change the way of learning. She said, \"IF YOU ARE BAD AT ANYTHING CO-RELATE IT WITH SOMETHiNG YOU ARE GOOD AT\". So I tried to do it and even my grades improved after that. I started reading the history of inventions and discoveries. That was the moment I realized that one cannot be a good scientist if he is not preeminent. I would like to share one of such scenarios.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<h2 data-original-attrs=\"{&quot;style&quot;:&quot;&quot;}\">Theory of light </h2>\n<div>\n<div class=\"separator\" data-original-attrs=\"{&quot;style&quot;:&quot;&quot;}\"><a data-original-attrs=\"{&quot;data-original-href&quot;:&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-l4o8RhG3zGg/WtBobpaQDoI/AAAAAAAAAAg/8aqHaSWt7tYno9mtVHV0NNg-EgiX1yC4QCLcBGAs/s1600/-untitled-.gif&quot;,&quot;style&quot;:&quot;&quot;}\" href=\"https://draft.blogger.com/u/1/blog/post/edit/9202629767217652780/6165044741028720531\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-l4o8RhG3zGg/WtBobpaQDoI/AAAAAAAAAAg/8aqHaSWt7tYno9mtVHV0NNg-EgiX1yC4QCLcBGAs/s400/-untitled-.gif\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  width=\"400\" height=\"225\" border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"720\" data-original-width=\"1280\"></a></div>\n<br>We know corpuscular theory by Newton in 1672 while it was already stated by Descartes in 1637.

Which was then stated by Huygens in 1678 which was contravening Newtons' theory. JUST BECAUSE OF NEWTON'S PRESTIGE AND POPULARITY, HIS THEORY WAS PREDOMINANT OVER HUYGENS'.
