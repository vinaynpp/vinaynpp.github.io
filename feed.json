And this lead to the idea of exchanging stuff (and not donating because everyone is greedy). Hence Barter system was developed. You give something the other person needs and get something you need in return... Win-Win situation. Both parties benefited. it can be in terms of goods(bananas, nuts) or also in terms of service(massaging, cleaning).</p>\n<p>It's all great and smooth if two people have opposite stuff to exchange. But it's really difficult to exchange when both people have the same stuff. I hope you know what i mean, Like who gives whom what? And what if first person has something the second person wants but the second person doesn't have something the first person wants.</p>\n<p>Let's see a table to understand this problem</p>\n<table style=\"border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%; height: 250px;\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height: 50px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 33.3333%; height: 50px;\">People</td>\n<td style=\"width: 33.3333%; height: 50px;\">Stuff they have</td>\n<td style=\"width: 33.3333%; height: 50px;\">Stuff they need </td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 50px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 33.3333%; height: 50px;\">A</td>\n<td style=\"width: 33.3333%; height: 50px;\">Carrots</td>\n<td style=\"width: 33.3333%; height: 50px;\">Iphone</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 50px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 33.3333%; height: 50px;\">B</td>\n<td style=\"width: 33.3333%; height: 50px;\">Bananas</td>\n<td style=\"width: 33.3333%; height: 50px;\">Carrots</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 50px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 33.3333%; height: 50px;\">C</td>\n<td style=\"width: 33.3333%; height: 50px;\">Nuts</td>\n<td style=\"width: 33.3333%; height: 50px;\">Bananas</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 50px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 33.3333%; height: 50px;\">D</td>\n<td style=\"width: 33.3333%; height: 50px;\">Iphone</td>\n<td style=\"width: 33.3333%; height: 50px;\">Nuts</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>So in order for \"A\" to get Iphone</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\"A\" gives Carrots to \"B\" and gets Bananas in return.</li>\n<li>\"A\" takes those Bananas and gives it to \"C\" and gets Nuts in return.</li>\n<li>\"A\" takes those Nuts and gives it to \"D\" to finally get Iphone.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Hectic right? so people thought what if we use something for exchange that everyone has but also has value to it so no one uses it in vain.</p>\n<p>And that's how concept of money was born. Some common stuff to exchange in order to get goods or services you want. It wasn't cash or bitcoins all the time, it started with declaring beads as common mode of exchange then shifted to coins and then paper. While now moving towards digital, The idea of having a common exchange value remains the same.</p>\n<h2>Liquidity</h2>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://vinaypanchal.com/media/posts/3/liquidity.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://vinaypanchal.com/media/posts/3/responsive/liquidity-xs.png 300w ,https://vinaypanchal.com/media/posts/3/responsive/liquidity-sm.png 480w ,https://vinaypanchal.com/media/posts/3/responsive/liquidity-md.png 768w ,https://vinaypanchal.com/media/posts/3/responsive/liquidity-lg.png 1024w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1500\" height=\"700\"></figure>\n<p>Liquid is something that takes shape of whatever you put it into. Like water takes shape of a bottle when poured into one or even a dish.</p>\n<p>Similarly Money is said to be liquid because when exchanged with anything it takes the value of that thing. We can buy Donut and a rocket with the same money. Of course the amount will differ a lot but it's money in both cases unlike Barter system.</p>\n<h2>Value of money</h2>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://vinaypanchal.com/media/posts/3/cash.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://vinaypanchal.com/media/posts/3/responsive/cash-xs.png 300w ,https://vinaypanchal.com/media/posts/3/responsive/cash-sm.png 480w ,https://vinaypanchal.com/media/posts/3/responsive/cash-md.png 768w ,https://vinaypanchal.com/media/posts/3/responsive/cash-lg.png 1024w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"548\" height=\"251\"></figure>\n<p> </p>",

            "content_html": "<p>Greetings!!!</p>\n<p>In this blog we will see how to make a Bot in python which will search everything you copy to clipboard. Source code at the end of blog.</p>\n<p>Past Covid-19 all examinations are conducted online and we all know why study if we can search everything on the internet. Particularly my university asked us to attempt exam through google form. So we had to follow a sequence of steps to search each question on the internet and get the solution.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Select the question and Hit Ctrl + C on the keyboard</li>\n<li>Open browser</li>\n<li>Visit each MCQ website where solutions can be available</li>\n<li>Search for solutions on all sites</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This steps had to be repeated for each and every question. Which felt hectic after few tests. So i wrote this bot which allowed me to perform just first step and rest were taken care by the bot.</p>\n<p>Enough ChitChat! Let's start with the actual code.</p>\n<p>First part will be importing the packages we will be needing to make this work.</p>\n<pre>from pynput import keyboard<br>import time<br>import clipboard<br>import webbrowser<br>import pip</pre>\n<p>Now you will be thinking...</p>\n<p>We imported everything but didn't install any package in our environment. Since this blog is all about automating steps we will be automating this part too. How? just copy paste this next block of code and run</p>\n<pre>def install(package):\n    if hasattr(pip, 'main'):\n        pip.main(['install', package])\n    else:\n        pip._internal.main(['install', package])\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    install('pynput')\n    install('clipboard')\n    install('webbrowser')</pre>\n<p>Now that we have all setup we can go dive into the main logic. We will create a text file and list down all the sites on which we want to search for the solutions and name the file \"sites.txt\". Here is my list for reference.</p>\n<pre>sanfoundry.com\nexamradar.com\nexamveda.com\ncoursehero.com\ncareerride.com\ntuteehub.com\nquizelet.com\nbrainscape.com\ncompsciedu.com\nciscopress.com\ngkseries.com\nengineeringinterviewquestions.com\nmcqslearns.com\ntexalab.com\nbrainly.in\neducationforever.in\nlecturenotes.in\npinoybix.org\ncalculator.in</pre>\n<p>Now we will ask for consent on which search engine to choose</p>\n<p>The one which keeps privacy safe - DuckDuckGo</p>\n<p>Or the one with plays with our privacy who's name shall not be taken (Google) </p>\n<pre>print(\"WHICH SEARCH ENGINE DO YOU USE?\")\nprint(\"ENTER '0' FOR DUCK DUCK GO \")\nprint(\"OR ANY OTHER NUMBER FOR GOOGLE\")\nbchoice = int(input(\"BE QUICK \\n\"))\n\nif bchoice == 0:\n    print(\"NOICE!!!

Start by saving clipboard string into a variable</p>\n<pre>text = clipboard.paste()</pre>\n<p>A query needs to be created so that we can search for it on any search engine. And that will be done by combining our text to be searched and the sites list. One more thing we cannot enter empty spaces in URL so we will replace them all with \"+\" symbol.</p>\n<pre>query = text + sites\nquery = query.replace(\" \", \"+\")\n</pre>\n<p>Compose final URL to be searched for based on the search engine choice and save it in a variable.</p>\n<pre>if bchoice == 0:\n    openbrow = \"https://duckduckgo.com/?q=\" + query\nelse:\n    openbrow = \"https://www.google.com/search?q=\" + query</pre>\n<p>Now we can open web browser and enter the URL using \"open\" method on \"webbrowser\" but new window for every question will be mess so we keep the new attribute as \"new=2\" and we also want to keep that tab in focus so \"autoraise=True\"</p>\n<pre>webbrowser.open(openbrow, new=2, autoraise=True)</pre>\n<p>The final funtion will look as following</p>\n<pre>def function_1():\n    text = clipboard.paste()\n    print(text)\n\n    query = text + sites\n    query = query.replace(\" \", \"+\")\n\n    if bchoice == 0:\n        openbrow = \"https://duckduckgo.com/?q=\" + query\n    else:\n        openbrow = \"https://www.google.com/search?q=\" + query\n\n    webbrowser.open(openbrow, new=2, autoraise=True)</pre>\n<p>Only thing left is to trigger this funtion when someone presses Ctrl key and C key at once. That's when a text is coppied into the clipboard. </p>\n<pre>with keyboard.GlobalHotKeys({\n    '&lt;ctrl&gt;+c': function_1}) as h:\n    h.join()</pre>\n<p>DONE!!! </p>\n<p>Now just run the file and you will be good to go.</p>\n<p>Source code of this entire bot can be found at <a href=\"https://github.com/vinaynpp/searchbot\" title=\"Github link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://github.com/vinaynpp/searchbot</a></p>\n<p> </p>",
