                                                        within the organization. Different
                                                        data sources can have different ways
                                                        to define a specific object, for
                                                        example, <i>product</i>. However, in
                                                        a data warehouse, there must be only
                                                        one definition of products. This is

                                                        resolution in the data warehouse.
                                                        And we when we achieve this we say

                                                        moment or span of time. In many

                                            <li>Often known as Inmon’s Top Down Approach ,
                                                data warehouse is built first. Inmon defines
                                                a data warehouse as a centralized repository
                                                for the entire enterprise.Dimensional data
                                                marts are created only after the complete
                                                data warehouse has been created. Thus, the
                                                data warehouse is at the center of the
                                                corporate information factory (CIF), which
                                                provides a logical framework for delivering
                                                business intelligence.</li>

                                                        all data marts are loaded from the

                                                    <li>This approach is robust against
                                                        business changes. Creating a new
